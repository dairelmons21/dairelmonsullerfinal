        <h1>Love Story (Taylorâ€™s Version)</h1>
            <p>We were both young when I first saw you
                I close my eyes and the flashback starts
                I'm standing there
                On a balcony in summer air
                See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
                See you make your way through the crowd
                And say "Hello"
                Little did I know
                That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
                And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
                And I was crying on the staircase
                Begging you, "Please don't go"
                And I said
                "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
                I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
                You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
                So I sneak out to the garden to see you
                We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
                So close your eyes
                Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
                'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
                And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
                But you were everything to me
                I was begging you, "Please don't go"
                And I said
                "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
                I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
                You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
                Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
                This love is difficult, but it's real
                Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes
                Oh, oh-oh
                I got tired of waiting
                Wondering if you were ever coming around
                My faith in you was fading
                When I met you on the outskirts of town
                And I said
                "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
                I keep waiting for you, but you never come
                Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
                He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
                And said
                "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
                I love you, and that's all I really know
                I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
                Oh, oh-oh
                Oh, oh-oh, oh
                'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
            </p>
